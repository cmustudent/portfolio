This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi!  I really like data.  And I like visualization.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualization!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously.

Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# Setting up a separate page. 

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](www.cmu.edu)
